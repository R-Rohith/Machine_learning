## Machine Learning
Machine learning invloves designing models capable of analysing and understanding data, and reply to realted queries.
There are the two self-explanatory methods of machine learning: **Supervised** and **Un-supervised** learning.

There mainly **n** kinds of machine learning problems:
- Regression
	- Linear regression: The labels are a linear combination of the features
	- Logistic regression: The result is a probability; i.e between 0 & 1.
